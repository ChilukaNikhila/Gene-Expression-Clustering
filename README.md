# Data Engineering and Machine learning of high-volume gene data
Dataset and the basic goal of the project is to find different clusters in the data. It is said that there are about sixteen different clusters, and have to predict the different test data points correctly on the sixteen different clusters.
# Dataset Description
The dataset contains gene expression data which contain 13177 rows and 13166 columns. It is an unlabeled dataset. The rows represent different samples and columns represent different gene names or features in the dataset.
